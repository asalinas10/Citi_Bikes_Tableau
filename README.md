# Citi Bikes Tableau

Since 2013, the Citi Bike program in New York City has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Each month, bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have questions about the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers using Tableau. 

Dats provided was collected from July and December 2022.
