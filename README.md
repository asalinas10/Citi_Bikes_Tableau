# Citi Bikes Tableau

Since 2013, the Citi Bike program in New York City has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Each month, bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have questions about the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers using Tableau. 

Dats provided was collected from July and December 2022.

4. What are the most popular days? Outliers?

    - July

![Alt text](<Screen Shot 2024-01-09 at 2.52.40 PM.png>)

- Most of the days numbers were consistently high with the excpetion of July 4th weekend which is a popular time for local citizens to be out of town. July 18th was also an outlier but after further investigation I discovered there was torrential raintorms that day as described in this article: https://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/weather/2022/07/18/parts-of-city-experienced-heavy-flooding-monday-afternoon

    - December

- Most days are consistent with a few outliers. December 11th had lower than usual numbers due to snow storm as shown in this article: https://www.news10.com/weather/12-11-2022-snow-day-sunday/. December 16th also had a low day due to another storm that came in: https://www.fox5ny.com/news/winter-storm-new-york-city-snow. December 25th was also low due to Christmas.

- Both graphs are consistent with each other in that their peak rental times coincide with rush hour.
